# Flitter
This is a repository for a Twitter clone, [KeepCoding-Glovo Women in Tech](https://keepcoding.io/nuestros-bootcamps/mujeres-glovo/ "KC Bootcamp") final project
The aim of this project is to put everything we've learnt during the bootcamp into practice and simulate a sprint where we develop a project to a deadline.
